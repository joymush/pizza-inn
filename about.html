        <p>
            In 1990 Eunisans came to Canada from England.After a few years working as a labourer,we 
            decided to do what she had done in our native England. "Bake Bread". The best and only way, we said, was to 
            bake it in a brick oven. So along with a few of our friends we built our 30' by 30' brick oven.The 
            bread business went well until the outbreak of World War II when all of my sons who has helped me in the business were drafted
            into millitary.
